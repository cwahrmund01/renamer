this is a test file with a unique word: goober
Whenever goober is found it should be changed
to the new string, whatever that may be. If
testing changes, you should make sure to
make a copy because if the word
goober changes but not all of them,
it will be a pain to find all of the
GOOBERS in order to replace them.
